This would ensure a smooth workflow for the team and limit confusion. I set up a <a href="https://github.com/ece-digitopoly/">github organization</a> where all the repositories for our code will lie. This is better than having it on personal accounts where tracking becomes a hassle. I also set up Kanban boards on the popular website <a href="https://trello.com/digitopoly">trello</a> for each section of the project to ensure that we are working towards specific tasks and are able to scope the features out early on.<br></p>

                    <p class="text-left">Week 2<br><br>Due Date: 08/30/2019<br><br>Total Hours: 7<br><br>Description of Design Efforts:<br>This week, I started off by assisting Alex when wiring up the XY plotter motors to the H bridge (DRV8825). I then moved on to look at possible options for monitors and scoping out the sizes of our subsystem so far. The movement track mentioned in the image is the track that the pieces will move on while the stationary track is the track where the pieces will be placed onto. As the image below shows, there’s a very specific size that our monitor must be (14.5in x 14.5in maximum) to maximize viewing pleasure and still have space for the electromagnet. The existing electromagnet that came with the XY plotter had a diameter of 1in which is too big for our project unless we decide to sacrifice on screen real estate. I found an <a href=" https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Electric-Lifting-Electromagnet-Solenoid/dp/B01N3387AA/">electromagnet</a> with a 0.5in diameter but it has half the amount of force, so we will have to evaluate those requirements soon. The monitors that work best for this are those with a 4:3 aspect ratio, commonly found these days on CCTV monitors. I picked out a couple different monitors on Amazon (<a href=" https://www.amazon.com/Inch-Security-Monitor-800X600-Built/dp/B07DCB62C1/">monitor 1</a> and <a href=" https://www.amazon.com/Eyoyo-Color-Security-Monitor-800X600/dp/B071HXX1XQ/">monitor 2</a>)for us to consider if the one we already had was too big.<br>Also, I started preliminary design work on what the screen would look like and started scoping out exact placements and fonts.</p>

I used JavaScript to make classes for the player and community chest and chance cards and displayed them on a canvas object. The code can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/ece-digitopoly/game-display">github repo</a>. I hooked up the RaspberryPi to our display and ran the code to get an idea of the sizing of the digital board as shown in the image.<br><br>I also started testing our Bluetooth breakout board (the STEVAL-IDB007V1M) and recognized the device on my phone as shown in the screenshot.</p>

As shown in the image below, the game board has taken a basic shape with 4 player bars, property cards if a player has bought them, icons and names for each player and the running money count for each player. Before I implemented them on the Raspberry Pi application, I wireframed some designs for the player bar that are also shown below. I hope to complete the other states of being in jail and bankruptcy in the next week.<br><br>I also worked with Niraj to test the UART capabilities of the Pi and the STM32F4. I worked on the STM32F4 with the HAL drivers to try and get UART to work, but I ran into a couple linker errors that I also hope to fix soon. On the Raspberry Pi side, Niraj and I used an npm package to get UART and read the values correctly on the oscilloscope. </p>

The potentiometer was soldered to the board and I removed the solder to get just the potentiometer. As shown by the video in Niraj’s progress report, we wired up a circuit to see how the wheel works on the oscilloscope. I then moved on writing some code for the microcontroller to read the output of the scroll wheel with GPIO, but since the potentiometer was just connected with jumper cables, the connections weren’t strong enough to get a smooth signal. The next step for that is to potentially solder it onto a protoboard to make it easier. <br><br>I also worked on writing the code to send JSON information from the STM32F4 to the Raspberry Pi. I wrote a few functions that sent over dummy action data over to test the communication aspect. <br></p>

                    <p class="text-left">Week 6<br><br>Due Date: 9/27/19<br><br>Total hours: 6 hours<br><br>Description of Design Efforts:<br>This week, I had two primary tasks. The first was to start writing code for gameplay on the STM32F4. We are using C++ so I started defining classes for each aspect of the game. Currently, I have the state machine set up for landing on a property and the actions that a user has to take after that. As defined in the software overview, there is an action class that takes an action based on the current game state and player position. <br><br>The next goal was to interface with the SPBTLE-1S bluetooth module on the STEVAL-IDB007V1M. The documentation was primarily defined for another module (the BlueNRG-1, the navigator of which is shown below), so information was sparse. I downloaded different toolchains namely Keil MicroVision and ST's Atollic to try and interface with it. Upon fixing numerous bugs, I was able to flash a piece of code onto the module to send a basic hello world message through UART as shown below in the image.<br><br>I also got started on transmitting orientation information from the IMU to the STEVAL board, so that will be my primary task for next week.</p>

I was having issues with the SPBTLE-1S that only flashed and ran precompiled example binaries. The ones that I generated didn't run at all. So, to test out the code we got a breakout board for the BlueNRG-2. I was able to flash custom code on that correctly and have it broadcast messages on the general Bluetooth channel. Further, I wired up the RN-4020 Bluetooth module, which is a simpler module we plan to use on the main microcontroller. I was able to use UART to transmit basic commands to setup the interface. Then, as shown in the video, I was able to get the BlueNRG-2 and the RN-4020 to connect and go through the pairing process to be bonded. I didn't get to transmit custom data between them yet, which will come next week. <br>We are also considering another Bluetooth board since the BlueNRG-2 needs a custom antenna that requires more effort on the PCB side.</p>
