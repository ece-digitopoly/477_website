Team members will login to the portal (screenshot attached below), enter text and upload relevant pictures, and click Submit, invoking a CGI script that will format the text and pictures with HTML tags and append it to the end of the page. Source code may be viewed <a href="https://github.com/ece-digitopoly/477_website/tree/master/Team/progress/submit">here</a>.<br><br>I started work on a library that will simplify controlling the XY plotter via the microcontroller. By abstracting the complicated procedures needed to move the centerpiece to a specific position, I plan to create simple functions that the game logic can call in order to ease development down the road.<br><br>I also wrote out the Functional Description, Theory of Operation, Computational/Electronic and Mechanical Constraint sections of the Functional Specification document.</p>

The aforementioned video depicts the blinking on the scope (we didn't have LEDs at the time) which was hooked up to PC0 on the microcontroller, which was set to blink roughly every second.<br><br>I was performing extensive component research this week on what we could use for the wireless die. I was intrigued by ULP (ultra-low-power) components, which I thought were critical to reducing power consumption on the die, which would have a very small battery and hence would require power consumption to be as close to zero as possible. Some of the parts I was considering are linked <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/TDK/WT525225-12F2-MA2-G?qs=sGAEpiMZZMvX9%2FGlEDuz9727vese0Pn6%252BO1xAfUt8faW8pFC2Bz4Lg%3D%3D">here</a>, <a href="https://www.mouser.com/new/bosch/bosch-sensortec-bmi270/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nxp.com/products/wireless/bluetooth-low-energy/qn908x-ultra-low-power-bluetooth-low-energy-system-on-chip-solution:QN9080">here</a>, and pictures of the components (a wireless coil, a ULP IMU from Bosch, and an NXP ULP microcontroller with Bluetooth) are also attached. <br><br>I helped Karthick with the Software Overview document and expanded on the reasoning behind the component choices in the Component Analysis document.</p>
